	Design steps
		1. Investigate architecture
		2. Determine domains
		3. Break services
		4. Detect Atomic domains.
		5. Design an API layer                                                         
			just a proxy                                   
				no data transformation
				no business logic.
		6. Design a unified logging strategy.
				use tracing tokens.                
			
	Design Drivers
		Separation of concerns
		avoid distribution taxes
			tie related services
		Design for Ci/CD
		Design logging and tracing
		Leverage domain driven design.
		build using async code. 
		Standardize stack where possible.
		Design an API Layer.
			Outbound edge services (offers)
			inbound/abstraction services 
				when interacting with 3rd parties.
		
	Hybrid Architectures
		Hierarchical service architecture
			Prevents circular dependencies.
		Service Based Architecture
			Unified Data store
			Services layer.
