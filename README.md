# Courses and learning mindmaps
This repository contains mindmaps for courses and articles I read,, I use mindmaps as a tool to capture knowledge which makes it much easier to connect ideas and remember what you had learned.

These mindmaps can be viewed and edited using the open-source tool https://tobloef.com/text2mindmap/
Feel free to use it for any purpose.
